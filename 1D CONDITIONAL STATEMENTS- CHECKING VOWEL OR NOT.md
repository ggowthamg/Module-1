## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements

## AIM  
To write a Python program that takes three integer inputs from the user and finds the smallest among them using the min() function.
## ALGORITHM  
Read the first number and store it in variable a.
Read the second number and store it in variable b.
Read the third number and store it in variable c.
Use the min() function to find the smallest of the three numbers and store it in variable x.
Display the values of a, b, c, and the smallest number x.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Write your code here
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())

x = min(a, b, c)
print(f"The Smallest  of the three a= {a} b= {b} c= {c} is {x}")
```
