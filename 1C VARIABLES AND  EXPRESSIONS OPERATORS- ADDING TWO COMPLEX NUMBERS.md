# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Adding Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To write a Python program that accepts two integer inputs from the user and performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication, then displays the results.

## ALGORITHM
Start
Read the first number and store it in variable x.
Read the second number and store it in variable y.
Calculate the sum of x and y, store in sum.
Calculate the difference of x and y, store in sub.
Calculate the product of x and y, store in mul.
Print the value of sum.
Print the value of sub.
Print the value of mul.

## PROGRAM
```python
#Write your code here
x = int(input(""))
y = int(input(""))

sum = (x+y)
sub = (x-y)
mul = (x*y)

print(sum)
print(sub)
print(mul)
```
